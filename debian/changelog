timekpr-next (0.2.4~ppa1~ubuntu1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * implemented TTY switching functionality for those cases, when login manager sits on different TTY than session itself (this should fix #1823717)
  **  the implementation is as follows: Timekpr-nExT tries to determine on which TTY login manager sits and saves it's TTY number, login managers have their
  **  own users in standard installations, therefore we detect them using specific usernames (maybe not the best solution, but it's a solution)
  * fixed control file initialization when timekpr starts (fixes #1802583)
  * fixed icon in notification area when there is no time limit per day, but time intervals are limited
  * improved termination list handling

timekpr-next (0.1.4~ppa1~ubuntu1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * first alpha version of timekpr (a lot has changed since old timekpr 0.3x version)
  ** new impementation of timekpr-revived (there is almost nothing left of timekpr-revived)
  ** released to very limited testers
  ** python3 and gtk3 are the must
  ** all based on DBUS (server and client)
  ** session management relies on systemd's login1
  ** notifications through DBUS (exclusively)
  ** server is managing everything, except notifications which is the responsibility of client
  ** major features include the following
  *** support DE's which implement appindicaor3 (Unity/Gnome3ยน/KDE5/...) and legacy statusIcon
  *** support Ubuntu 12.04+ (on launchpad timekpr can support the versions which are on supported distro list)
  *** it's possible to configure which session types are accountable
  *** inactive session time is NOT accounted (if configured so)
  *** time is configurable by days, hours and minutes (yes, limits within hour are possible)
  *** there is no "hard" account lock, user will be logged out in 15 seconds if time is over
  *** synchronous operation between  server and client
  *** improved notifications about system behaviour
  **** notification about actual limit change
  **** notification about general configuration change
  **** notification logic improved
  **** client acts merely as notificator
  **** client can view limits applied by admin

  ยน one has to install extension to show timekpr icon, otherwise icon is not shown (gnome architects do not want status icons in their design anymore, timekpr can not do anything about it)
